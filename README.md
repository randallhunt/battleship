# Battleship

This project began as a mental exercise and whiteboarding experiment during a job interview a few years ago, but the idea was fun and it seemed like a really good way to showcase proficiency in several different technologies at once.  So I decided to make a Battleship implementation using **Elixir** and **Phoenix**, **Vue.js**, **Tailwind.css**, and **Redis**, using **Websockets**.

There is plenty of room for improvement, including potential future features including a waiting room, user stats, and more, and could indeed be turned into a full Battleship server on a whim, if inspiration strikes.

## Requirements

You will need to have the following installed on your system in order to use this:

 * Elixir
 * Redis
 * Node

All can be installed through _apt-get_ or _homebrew_.

## Getting started

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
